# CompGraph_MIT_6_837
Repo for assignments of OpenCourseWare course Computer Graphics 6.837\
This is freetime project for own educational purposes, if you notice something odd or wrong in the code please report it to me.\
Only checked tasks are implemented.

## Assignment00

*Basic tasks:*
- [x] Color changes
- [x] Light position changes
- [x] Mesh loading and display

*Extra credit tasks:*
- [x] Key 'r' spins the model
- [x] Display the model using OpenGL display lists or vertex buffer objects
- [x] Key 'c' smoothly transitions between different colors
- [x] Mouse based camera control: zoom, move and rotate
- [ ] Mesh simplification method

## Assignment01

*Basic tasks:*
- [x] Implementing curves
- [x] Implementing surfaces

*Extra credit tasks*
- [x] Render your model more interestingly. Color is depending on normal positions
- [ ] Implement another type of spline curve
- [ ] Implement another type of primitive curve that is not a spline
- [x] Closed curves start and endpoints meet seamlessly
- [ ] Piecewise Bezier curves with sharp corners
- [ ] Implement user interface so that it is easy for users to specify curves using mouse control
- [ ] Implement a recursive subdivision technique to adaptively control the discretization so that more samples are taken when neede
- [ ] Extend the generality of generalized cylinders by allowing the profile curve to be controlled by other curves as well. For instance, you may wish to not only control the orientation of the profile curve using a sweep curve, but the relative scale of the profile curve using a scale curve
- [ ] Implement a birail surface
- [ ] Implement piecewise Bezier and B-spline surfaces
- [ ] Implement subdivision surfaces
